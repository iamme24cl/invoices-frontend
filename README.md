## General Information
- Create, update and delete invoices.
- Easily manage invoicing your Clients, download the invoice as pdf onto your computer or print it out on paper.
- I built this application to practice building a dynamic web application using React and Redux.

## Technologies Used
Ruby on Rails
React
Redux

## Setup
All depencies are listed in package.json file. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Usage
* Clone this backend repository to your machine  https://github.com/iamme24cl/invoices-backend
* Run `bundle` to install all gems listed in the gemfile
* Run `rails db:create && db:migrate` to create and migrate the database (If you are on a windows machine, you will need to make sure your PostgreSQL server is running. You can easily manage this in the PGAdmin desktop application.)
* Run `rails s` to run the server
* On Your front-end folder run `npm install && npm start` to install all dependecies listed in the package.json file and start the server and run the application in the browser.
